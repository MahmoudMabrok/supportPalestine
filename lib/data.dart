      """Let me tell you an incident that took place about 12 years ago. Our loved ones in Gaza have an authentic family called the Samouni family. Among them is
a person who was 13 years old in 2009 at the time of the incident, his name is Abdullah al-Samuni. Abdullah says that at dawn on January 3, 2009, the
family woke up from sleep, terrified by the sound of an explosion under the house. The sound was an explosive device detonated by the occupying forces
under the house in Al-Zaytoun neighborhood, south of Gaza. Not only that, the soldiers continued to strike random fire everywhere for about a quarter of
an hour, after which they asked about the owner of the house, so an elderly man named Attia al-Samuni went out with his hand raised. Simply put, they
shot him without introductions.
After that, they broke into the house and entered a room where the women and children of the household gathered, and the random fire continued to hit
the ceiling and walls of the room. The goal was not to kill them all along, no, the goal was to spread terror. And spread terror, causing the death of a child
and a woman, and then three children were hit, one of them with four bullets in the chest and head, another in the right thigh and a third in the leg. Then
the soldiers decided to have a little fun. So they went and bombed another room in the house , smoke spread to the injured children and women who were
still alive among the dead, suffocating them, and a baby girl, who was only two weeks old, was about to suffocate but the mother ran into another room to
save her . After a while, the soldiers were almost exhausted from the game, so they decided to expel the family because the sight of blood and the
screaming disturbed them.
The mother ran with her four-year-old injured child with four bullets in one hand, and the seven-year-old, with a bulley in his thigh in the other hand, trying
to reach any hospital.
The family moved 300 meters away from the house, and other soldiers met them, refusing to let them pass, and asked them to go to Rafah, that was 38
kilometers away. The mother refused and ran into a house that belonged to her relatives, and of course at that time the four-shot child was dead. Abdullah
tells: Before he died, he used to say: I want to take you to heaven. In the morning, the afflicted family went out carrying white flags and only hoped for
treatment for those who had not yet died, until some ambulances arrived (which were only 3 km away from them).
The al-Samuni family lost 29 martyrs in the Gaza war, among the weeping situations for them also that the occupation asked 100 of them to gather in one
house, owned by Wael al-Samuni, and then fired randomly until morning. According to members of the Palestinian Red Crescent, it is said that the number
of those who were killed approached seventy.
The Zionists at that time used internationally banned weapons, such as white phosphorous, which causes distortions to all elements of the environment,
water, air, animals, and burns to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system. White phosphorous, when explodeds it burns anything it encounters from the first
human to the soil. Zionists are trying to get the sympathy of the world, despite the fact that they were the ones who were bombing, and killing the people of
Gaza yesterday."""
